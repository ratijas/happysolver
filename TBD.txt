NEW DEAL - things that don't work
-------------

save file
load old files
side panel in solution view
symmetry


build view - start tile
  not yellow
  white when cube is to be removed

new shape doesn't work


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


BUGS:
------
Vista start menu short cut doesn't work




---- Environment ---------------
- double click a file to open in the same window
- registering file icons with OS??? different for slv.
   - on MAC
- application Icon on finder - OSX - better resolution
- uninstall link in Start menu (windows installer)


---- Engine --------------------
- multiple threads
- accessing the opt struct during run.
- flatenning of the shape ?
- identify rtns by their absolute rtn value, not the compressed one. to get rid of sym in solutions
- first part rotate???
- advanced: use only X pieces of this set
- remove luck if more then X time.
  - OR - more dynamic luck?
- advanced pieces selection - not more then X of this cube.

- move the production of the PicsSet to the thread? large latency when solving with 1000 pieces.


- better shape heuristic:
  - different plane is better
  - not resizing the bounding box is better
     - by less volume
  - capping volumes is better
  - open circumference

- BUG: counting twice as much as real changes. (single pic shape)

---- GUI -----------------------
- load/save progress bar, long operations progress bar
- help file.
- continuous ?
- Save VS Save As.
- kid mode? side bar with ready made shapes, "what do you want to do?"

- backwards slashes in recent
- solve it after changing the desing when there are solutions. should be a better message on what's going on.
- new menu - pieces
   - save, load pieces set (via registry)
   - save new size of sidebars in registry - difficult...
- resize of opengl is only vertical - opengl problem...
- move lights to up and down ?
- splash screen?
- white frame for black piece on pic view
- tab stops? in main gui, in pics view
- tooltips on all buttons
- status bar - "Add" or "Remove" fixed indicator
- Add, Remove buttons add "(ctrl)"
- label next to spinbox in PicsView
- generate error with divided shape, color one of the shapes
   - special case - a body with a complete hole
- disable fade during run..
   - automatically detect if we don't do the fade right ?
- BuildView - when is it centeralizes? why? when else?
- steps not in a seperate dialog (???)
- grey out the remove button when there is only one cube, explain in tooltip
- Advanced pieces - close to have an X icon
- in model label of piece resized every time.

-* pressing the name of the pieces is a hyper link when in advanced.
- solution sidebar - pressing next on last solution runs engine. (with msg box?)
- when pressing start when in the solution view, don't go to the first solution when it arrives. ???
- shouldn't do anything else while generation pieces, except close.
- edit in build while running should say "you can't edit while running"


- BUG:? after two loads, changes becomes -4000000000 ??
- BUG: build helper- on build error, the error message comes over the pics select. QT Layout bug?

- change colors - also little genious (?)

- QTBUG: step slider not fitting 1..6. resize does not change ticks, 6 pieces not showing ticks.


QT4.3:
    * [158951] Buttons with icons now center their content to be more
      consistent with buttons that do not have icons in most styles.
    * [134164] Ensured that top-level widgets configured with
      MSWindowsFixedSizeDialogHint are centered properly.


---- 3D engine -----------------
- flat10x10 - edges not quite right. - not much can be done?
- problems with step by step in solution: - same
   - white framed pieces are likely to change on all wrapped
   - missing lines due to single piece rendering

- configurable pool size?
- fade of blue tiles is slow when rotating.

- bad textures on mac.
- further perspective


---- Document Model ------------
- export to PNG
- "not too many pieces" for large structures, not linear..
- maybe: reset the pieces selection when a build is loaded (it's not reseted now)
- unification of Shape & Solves files:
  - a way to extrapulate the build from a shape
     - use when there is no build on open
- undo?
- loaded structures that are on the rim - move them.


---- SI ------------------------
- QRegion - intersects
- SI: use opengl painter??

---- Code ----------------------
- GPL notice for new files
- seperate to more files
- compare floats?
- what is memory going for?
- Cleanup ShapeIFS, public, private
- maybe make lightVector<T, Max> ?
- move generateIFS away from Cube
- code cleanup
   - public members
   - lists which are not lists



QT bugs:
- not able to float floating toolbars, windows QT bug?
vX- not able to draw a line on a QImage
v- native file dialog doesn't support default extension
v- can't make a native file dialog with QFileDialog objects
- after floating on a menu, the blue stays on
- disabled menu items still lights when hover
- when in modal dialog, clicking the father window, focus does not return. fix in 4.1.1??
vOK- wglMakeCurrent failed ignored silently as far as the API is concerned
xv- dock windows resizing if not processEvents, looses XP [X]
xv- moc: types of signals are enum of a class, fully qualified name needed in definition
vOK- tooltip time
xv- layoutitem in layout
v- qbutton missing features - center image, image on top
xv- qthread delete self (pics thread)
xv- updateGL calles painGL even though setUpdatesEnabled(false) (modelhelp)
v- unsuported gif - infinite loop
v- mng playing infinite
v- dialog does not close when parent closes
vOK- toolbutton not pressed
v- crash (1) under X
xv- same texture bound to two QGLWidgets
vOK- QLabel with colored text get disabled badly
- OpenGL textures on Intel


QT:
- opengl failed? what to do? (compuware) - wglMakeCurrent failing ignored.
- tune fonts?


QT4.2

- check AA_ImmediateWidgetCreation
- toNativeSeparators


Future versions:
- QTBUG- don't reimplement FileDialog overwrite

OpenGL:
- use glHint?

Linux
- fonts in gl in 0/0 solves, color
- texture doesn't show in the solution sidebar

OSX
- check wheel response

tests on other platforms:
- colors of star-little.slv
- background of pieces view - scroll+tab
- fonts!!!
- dialogs.. labels
- quickly press Ctrl and watch if remove get confused...
- command line solution, are the pieces loaded ok?
- pics thread

before final:
- update the examples directory. fix the shapes with new limits.
- test for memory steppings, memory leaks
- test all examples. eliminate unneeded files. (shapes)

Strange:
- dangerous to use QFont outside the GUI thread???


- move to xml!
- a Dialog that tells info about the shape
	- number of faces
	- number of corners
	- number or sides (find other name)
	- volume
	- closing box metrics
	- number of solutions
	(when xml)
	- last created
	- last modified
	- last generated
  current solution
    - symetrics - none, inside, outside (change)
	(when xml)
	- created

	- if not generated try to generate, if unable show blanks





No:
- intel compiler
- translate + rotate does something sensible
- static build? of QT
- move MainFrame to UI ??? - no actiongroups
- lines belong to more then one piece
- (MFC) fade effect leaves marks on display
- return to last view on buttons - bad GUI
- better flood fill, with queue - test 50x50x50 (no optimization needed...)
- move shapeIFS to OpenGL call lists, for every piece. (probably consume much more memory, need two for everything, with target and without)
- save solutions - current, all, specific select
- ModelSidebar - name of the grp of the current pic ???
- PicsView - solve button ???
- have to ability to change the background.
- 3d options in model and build, cullface
- grey out Zoom when there are no solves
- recalc size->move somehow make is smooth??
- ??? options - tiled/boxed, with/without fade
